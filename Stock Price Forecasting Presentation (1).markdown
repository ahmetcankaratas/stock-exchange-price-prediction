# Stock Price Forecasting: BIST 50 and THYAO Analysis

## Slide 1: Title
"Welcome to my presentation on 'Stock Price Forecasting: BIST 50 and THYAO Analysis.' Today, I'll walk you through a comprehensive stock price prediction project that combines two powerful approaches: Prophet for broad BIST 50 index analysis and LSTM for detailed Turkish Airlines (THYAO) forecasting."

## Slide 2: Problem Definition & Purpose
"Our project addresses two key challenges in stock market prediction:
1. Creating a scalable, user-friendly tool for forecasting multiple BIST 50 stocks
2. Developing a sophisticated, deep learning-based analysis for Turkish Airlines (THYAO)

The goal is to provide both broad market insights and detailed company-specific predictions, leveraging the strengths of different modeling approaches."

## Slide 3: Tools & Technologies
"We utilized a comprehensive tech stack:
- Data Collection: yfinance API for real-time and historical stock data
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and feature engineering
- Modeling: 
  - Prophet for BIST 50 stocks (handling seasonality and trends)
  - LSTM with TensorFlow/Keras for THYAO (capturing complex patterns)
- Visualization: Plotly for interactive charts, Matplotlib for static plots
- Deployment: Streamlit for the interactive web application"

## Slide 4: Data Collection & Preparation
"For BIST 50 stocks:
- Collected 4 years of daily closing prices for all 50 stocks
- Implemented automated data fetching through yfinance
- Created a unified data pipeline for consistent processing

For THYAO:
- Gathered high-frequency data (5-minute intervals)
- Added technical indicators:
  - Moving Averages (5-day, 20-day)
  - RSI, MACD
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Volume-based features
- Implemented sequence preparation for LSTM (60-day windows)"

## Slide 5: System Architecture
"Our system consists of three main components:
1. Data Pipeline:
   - Automated data collection
   - Real-time data processing
   - Feature engineering
   - Data validation

2. BIST 50 Forecasting Module:
   - Prophet-based predictions
   - Interactive Streamlit interface
   - Confidence interval visualization

3. THYAO Analysis Module:
   - LSTM model with hyperparameter tuning
   - Technical indicator integration
   - Advanced visualization tools"

## Slide 6: Implementation Details
"BIST 50 Module:
```python
model = Prophet(daily_seasonality=True)
model.fit(data)
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=days)
forecast = model.predict(future)
```

THYAO Module:
```python
# LSTM Architecture
model.add(LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(60, 11)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(units=32))
model.add(Dense(units=1))
```

Key Features:
- Automated data pipeline
- Real-time predictions
- Interactive visualizations
- Performance metrics tracking"

## Slide 7: Results & Performance
"BIST 50 Results:
- Successfully implemented for all 50 stocks
- Interactive web interface for easy access
- Confidence intervals for risk assessment

THYAO Results:
- High accuracy in short-term predictions
- Effective capture of market patterns
- Integration of technical indicators
- Performance metrics:
  - MSE: [Value]
  - RMSE: [Value]
  - MAE: [Value]"

## Slide 8: Visualization & User Interface
"Our Streamlit application provides:
1. Stock Selection:
   - Dropdown for BIST 50 stocks
   - Custom prediction periods
   - Technical indicator toggles

2. Interactive Charts:
   - Historical price trends
   - Prediction confidence intervals
   - Technical indicator overlays

3. Performance Metrics:
   - Real-time accuracy measures
   - Comparative analysis tools"

## Slide 9: Future Enhancements
"Planned improvements:
1. Model Enhancements:
   - Hybrid Prophet-LSTM approach
   - Additional technical indicators
   - Sentiment analysis integration

2. System Improvements:
   - Real-time data updates
   - Automated model retraining
   - Enhanced visualization options

3. Feature Additions:
   - Portfolio optimization
   - Risk assessment tools
   - Automated trading signals"

## Slide 10: Conclusion
"Our project successfully combines two powerful approaches to stock price prediction:
- Prophet for scalable, user-friendly BIST 50 forecasting
- LSTM for sophisticated THYAO analysis

The integrated system provides both broad market insights and detailed company-specific predictions, making it valuable for different types of investors and analysts."
