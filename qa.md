# Stock Price Prediction Project - Q&A

## Model Selection and Architecture

### Q: Why did you choose Prophet and LSTM for this project?
**A:** We chose these two models because they serve different purposes:
- Prophet is excellent for capturing long-term trends and seasonality in BIST 50 stocks
- LSTM is better at capturing complex patterns and short-term movements in THYAO
- This combination gives us both broad market insights and detailed company-specific predictions

### Q: How do you handle missing data in your dataset?
**A:** We handle missing data in several ways:
- For Prophet: It automatically handles missing data points
- For LSTM: We remove rows with NaN values using pandas' dropna() function
- We also implement data validation checks to ensure data quality
- Before removing NaN values, we ensure we have enough data points for our sequence length

### Q: What metrics do you use to evaluate your models?
**A:** We use multiple metrics to ensure comprehensive evaluation:
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- We also visualize predictions against actual values for qualitative assessment

## Technical Implementation

### Q: How do you ensure your model isn't overfitting?
**A:** We prevent overfitting through:
- Using dropout layers in LSTM
- Implementing early stopping
- Cross-validation
- Regularization techniques
- Monitoring training vs validation loss

### Q: Why did you choose these specific technical indicators?
**A:** We selected indicators that provide complementary information:
- Moving Averages (5-day, 20-day) for trend analysis
- RSI for overbought/oversold conditions
- MACD for momentum
- Bollinger Bands for volatility
- Volume indicators for market participation

### Q: How do you handle the high volatility in stock prices?
**A:** We address volatility through:
- Data normalization
- Using confidence intervals in Prophet
- Implementing robust error handling
- Considering multiple timeframes
- Using technical indicators to capture market sentiment

## Project Implementation

### Q: What's the advantage of using Streamlit for this project?
**A:** Streamlit offers several benefits:
- Easy creation of interactive web interfaces
- Real-time data visualization
- User-friendly stock selection
- Dynamic parameter adjustment
- Quick deployment and sharing

### Q: How do you validate your predictions?
**A:** We validate predictions through:
- Backtesting on historical data
- Cross-validation
- Out-of-sample testing
- Comparing with actual market movements
- Using multiple evaluation metrics

## Project Limitations and Future Work

### Q: What are the limitations of your approach?
**A:** Our approach has several limitations:
- Market conditions can change rapidly
- External factors (news, events) aren't directly considered
- Historical patterns may not always predict future behavior
- Limited by data quality and availability
- Computational resources for real-time updates

### Q: How would you improve this project?
**A:** Potential improvements include:
- Adding sentiment analysis from news
- Implementing more advanced models (Transformer, XGBoost)
- Including more market indicators
- Real-time data updates
- Portfolio optimization features

## Technical Choices

### Q: Why did you choose Python for this project?
**A:** Python was chosen because:
- Rich ecosystem of data science libraries
- Easy integration with various APIs
- Strong community support
- Excellent visualization capabilities
- Good performance for our use case

### Q: How do you handle different timeframes in your analysis?
**A:** We handle timeframes by:
- Using daily data for BIST 50
- Implementing 5-minute intervals for THYAO
- Considering multiple timeframes for validation
- Adjusting model parameters based on timeframe
- Using appropriate technical indicators for each timeframe

## Additional Technical Questions

### Q: How do you handle data preprocessing?
**A:** Our preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Feature engineering
- Technical indicator calculation
- Sequence preparation for LSTM
- Data validation and quality checks
- NaN handling strategy:
  * We use pandas' dropna() to remove rows with missing values
  * This approach is preferred over forward-fill because:
    - It maintains data integrity by not introducing artificial values
    - Prevents potential bias in our LSTM model's training
    - Ensures more reliable predictions by using only complete data points
  * Before removing NaN values, we verify sufficient data points remain for our sequence length
  * We implement data quality checks to ensure the remaining data is valid and consistent

### Q: What's your approach to model tuning?
**A:** We use several approaches:
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Cross-validation
- Grid search for optimal parameters
- Learning rate scheduling
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

### Q: How do you ensure model reliability?
**A:** We ensure reliability through:
- Regular model retraining
- Performance monitoring
- Error analysis
- Validation on different market conditions
- Continuous model evaluation

### Q: What's your data collection strategy?
**A:** Our data collection includes:
- Real-time data from Yahoo Finance
- Historical data for training
- Multiple timeframes
- Technical indicators
- Market metadata

### Q: How do you handle model deployment?
**A:** We handle deployment through:
- Streamlit web application
- Regular updates
- Error handling
- User feedback integration
- Performance monitoring
